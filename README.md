 Execution Engine (ExEn)
  <br>
</h1>

A freeware solution developed by In-Fusio (French) around 2000. The company re-developed the ExEn V2 engine in 2002, which further improved the speed and expressiveness of mobile. It was first a Java-based game engine entirely dedicated to mobile devices itself as an alternative to the limitations of J2ME/BREW's game development (offering missing feautures like sprite zooming, parallax scrolling, rotations...).

The API is based on Java and is very similar to J2ME, but is optimized for game development and deployment instead. Even the programming style is almost the same. Its significance is very similar to the Mophun platform. The ExEn API has various gaming specific classes that are absent from J2ME. ExEn was the first mass market downloadable game engine to be made available in Europe. It achieved relative success and widespread hardware support in Europe, and was also used in China. It's not as widely distributed though, and according to In-Fusio's website, it isn't available on Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Samsung or Motorola handsets.

The In-Fusio SDK is a Java based GUI game development environment on ExEn. Two kinds of engines on the client side mobile phone.

ExEn basic (v2.1): 256-color or black and white, 2D, client side game engine, with a memory footprint of 140k on the mobile device.

ExEn advanced (v2.2): 65k color, polyphonic sound, 3D, in-game Macromedia Flash, client side engine, with a memory footprint of 240k.
